# Vinyl-Reader-Code
Some scripts I made for a little test in Unity (Available on pughutstudios.com soon!)

# HOW TO USE
STEP 1, ADDING THE SCRIPT: Drop the .cs script in to your Unity project and add it to any object (Preferablly an empty one or the camera)
STEP 2, FOLDER SETUP: Run the game once. This will create the "Albums" folder in the game's directory.
STEP 3, ALBUM COVER SETUP: In the "Albums" folder, create a new folder with your album name (The names have nothing to do with the script, its just for the organization).
Find your album cover. A really good place for high quality album covers is albumartexchange.com. Name your album cover "COVER.png" (NOTE: Everything in the name IS CASE SENSITIVE. It MUST BE A PNG).
Put your album cover in your album folder.

And you are done!

# VINYL BACK-SIDES
STEP 1, IMAGE NAME: The back image should be named "BACK.png" (Also case-sensitive)
(With the provided model, Continue. If you have the same problems, also continue. If it's orientation is correct, you're good and done here.)
STEP 2, IMAGE CORRECTION: Flip the image up-side-down, and flip it so when you rotate your head 180 degrees clockwise you can read it.
You are now done with the back sides
